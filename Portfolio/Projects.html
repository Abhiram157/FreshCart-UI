                <p class="p1-text">Here is a fully functional Calculator Web Page. The basic structure of the Calculator is made using HTML. We have different buttons for different values and operations. The positioning and other styling is done using CSS. The functionality of the buttons is provided by JavaScript which displays our input in the assigned area. The entire mathematical expression is considered as a string and it is evaluated using the eval() function in JavaScript and the output is displayed. The display is cleared when we click on the 'Reset' button. </p>

                <p class="p2-text">This project is about a fully automatic Snakes and Ladders Game. For simplicity, the game starts from position 1 and ends at position 30. There are only snakes in the game and no ladders. The number from a dice is generated by the srand() function. The value of the dice is added to our position. If the sum of our position and the dice value puts us in a position where a snake is placed, we immediately reach to the tail of the snake. To make things interesting, a feature is added which concludes the game is over if our position is exactly 30 only and for any value other than 30, the dice value is discarded. If the position value reaches 29, a Master Snake throws the player out of the board to position 0 and the game is lost. For better user experience, a sleep() function is used which delays the output messages by the specified time period. The code for this game is written entirely in C Language. </p>

                <p class="p3-text">Here is a Number Guessing Game made using Python. The game has four difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard and custom. With increasing difficulty, the range of numbers increases. The user has to guess the number that the system randomly picks for that difficulty level. Everytime the user guesses a number, he receives a hint whether the actual number is higher or lower than the guessed number. When the user correctly guesses the number, the number of attempts made by the user will be displayed and the name of the user will be taken. The name of the user, difficulty level and number of attempts are then stored in a csv file and according to the difficulty level that the user has chosen, the statistics for that particular difficulty level will also be displayed.</p>
